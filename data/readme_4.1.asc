Brief summary of changes from Version 3.0 to 4.0/4.1
------------------------------------------------

1) Version 4.0 incorporates new estimates for trade with Taiwan, 
which is not included altogether in the IMF data. These estimates
are taken from two sources, 1971 to 2002 data from the Directorate 
General of Budget Accounting and Statistics Executive Yuan of 
the ROR (Taiwan), and 1952 to 1974 data from the Statiscal Yearbook 
of ROC (Taiwan). These data were collected and converted into $US 
by Zhiming Chen and Bruce M. Russett of Yale University.

2) Version 4.0 fixes a problem in Version 3.0 of the data where some of 
the missing initial leads for certain observations were replaced 
by interpolated values rather than deflated estimates based on the first-non
missing flows

3) IMF lists values for Vietnam, without distinguishing whether values 
refer to North and South Vietnam before unification. The
hard copy of the IMF yearbook for 1977, however, states on p. 262 that 
"values through 1974 refer to the former South Vietnam". In this 
new version, it is therfore assumed that all data for Vietnam up through 1974
refer to South Vietnam. I am grateful to Bruce M. Russett for locating
this information in the hard copies of the IMF yearbook.

4) The GDP data have been updated with base data from the new 6.1 version of
the Penn World Tables

5) Version 4.1 corrects a problem in the 4.0 version of the GDP data that
led to incorrect estimates for many countries not in the PWT 6.1 data with
numerical numbers higher than 450 

6) The 20 August 2004 version of the 4.1 data introduce two corrections
to the file file expdata.asc. The 21 July 2004 did not incoroporate the 
changes to the 4.1 version of the GDP data noted under 5) or data on n
gdp and population for the years 1998-2000.

Variable descriptions
--------------------------------------------
Note:

- The trade data are given in millions of 
	current year US dollars
- The population figures are in 1000s
- The real GDP per capita figures are real figures 
	in constant US dollars (base 1996)

acra/b		Three letter acronym for state A/B	
numa/b		Numeric id code for state A/B
year		Year
expab		Export A to B
eabo		Export A to B origin code
impab		Import A from B
iabo		Import A from B origin code
expba		Export B to A 		
ebao		Export B to A origin code
impba		Import B from A 
ibao		Import B from A origin code
popa		Population of A
rgdpca/b	Real GDP per capita of A/B
cgdpca/b	Current GDP per capita of A/B
goa/b		Origin of GDP per capita estimate A/B
tottra/b	Total trade for country A/B


Table 1: GDP and population data categories
--------------------------------------------
Code	Data origin	
0	Observed data from the Penn World Tables data 6.1	
-1      Observed data point from Penn World Tables data 5.6, with
		no corresponding point in PWT 6.1 (a)
1	Lags and leads based on first non-missing observations, 
		deflated to current prices
2	Interpolated estimates (a)
3	Estimate based on figures from the CIA World Factbook

Notes:  (b) Some observations have missing data on one but not all of the 
	the three figures from the Penn World Tables. PWT 6.1 figures are 
	used whenever available, but the -1 code is used whenever any of 
	the figures are taken from the PWT 5.6 data 

	(a) The previous version had no missing observations within 
	time series in the GDP data. This is not the case for these 
	data. All of these gaps are between observations from 
	PWT 5.6 (i.e., -1s) and PWT 6.1 (i.e., 0s)

Supplementary information on files


1) trade_dd.asc	
-----------------
This file provides trade flows for directed dyads. Each pair of 
states A and B will give rise to two rows, one for the flow 
from A to B in that year, another for the flow from B to A 
in that year


2) trade_udd.asc
-----------------     
This file provides trade flows for undirected dyads. Each pair 
of states A and B will give rise to a single row only, with 
export and imports from A to B and exports and imports from 
B to A. The data are sorted on the numeric country id. Each 
dyad is included as AB whenever country number
of A < country number of B, as BA otherwise. 


3) pwt_v6.asc
-----------
This file contains GDP per capita and population data


4) cowfilter.pl
---------------
Files 1-3 are based on the definition of the population of 
independent states in the international system after 1945 
based on the criteria described in 

	Gleditsch, Kristian S., and Michael D. Ward. 1999. 
		"A Revised List of Independent States Since 1816."
		International Interactions 25:393-413.

Note that the data here also incorporate the supplementary list 
of microstates with fewer than 250,000 inhabitants. 

Observations for some states and time periods in these data will 
not be considered states in the international system as defined 
by the Correlates of War project's system membership list. 

The file cowfilter.pl contains Perl code to generate files 5 and 6 
below, which provide undirected trade flows and GDP data on 
the population of states and dyads as defined by the COW project. 
The code can easily be change to modify the directed dyad data

5) uddtrade_cow.asc
-----------------
Alternate version of file 2, adhering to COW conventions

6) pwt_cow.asc
-----------------
Alternate version of file 3, adhering to COW conventions
    
7) expopen.asc
-----------------
Total trade measures for each state and years, calculated
from the expanded trade data, using all categories

8) expdata.asc
-----------------
File with trade, gdp, population, and openness measures for all 
undirected dyads




Brief summary of changes from Version 2.1 to 3.0
------------------------------------------------

1) Version 3.0 contains trade data for 1997-2000, which Professor Andrew 
G. Long of the Department of Political Science, University of Mississippi 
generously has made available.

Long collected data on trade figures valued in millions of current 
US dollars for 1997-2000 from the IMF Direction of Trade (DOT) Yearbook 
for 2002. The data were originally recorded in a spreadsheet file, 
containing Exports from A to B and from B to A and Imports by A from B 
and by B from A, along with a dichotomous variable recording whether 
the import data were valued f.o.b. or c.i.f.  Gleditsch then modified 
the original Perl code to merge the updated 1997-2000 IMF DOT data 
onto the original 1948-1996 IMF DOT trade data, before carrying out 
the subsequent operations described in Gleditsch (2002). Note that 
trade data were not collected for any dyads involving certain 
microstates with very small populations, more specifically Barbados, 
Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, 
Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts-Nevis, Seychelles, Vanuatu, 
Marshall Islands, Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, and 
Western Samoa. As a consequence, the 1997-2000 figures reported for 
dyads involving these states are either category 5 (deflated 
values of the last non-missing observation) or 6 (observations 
set to 0).

The 1997 to 2000 data were physically entered by hand, and we 
cannot guarantee that the data are free from typographical mistakes.  
We ask that any user noticing any potential problems or 
mistakes in the 1997 to 2000 figures report these to Andrew 
Long (aglong@olemiss.edu) and Kristian Skrede 
Gleditsch (kgleditsch@ucsd.edu).


2) Version 3.0 of the data incorporate certain changes to 
the Gleditsch and Ward list of independent states that the 
expanded trade and GDP data are based on. The principal change 
is that the country label for the United Kingdom has changed 
from UK to UKG in May 2003, in order to comply with the three 
letter acronym convention used for other states in these data. 
The other changes are minor changes to a country's date of independence. 

See http://weber.ucsd.edu/~kgledits/statelist.html for additional 
information on the Gleditsch and Ward data on independent state 
and the full case description list.

3) The Perl code used to create version 2.1 of the data generated 
incorrect figures for some trade flows involving the 
United Kingdom. These problems were due to the two letter country 
code, and do not appear in Version 3.0 of the data.

4) The cowfilter.pl code has been updated to reflect the recent
changes in the COW system membership list and its labels. Notably,
the COW project has changed its label for Russia/Soviet Union from 
URS to RUS, changed the label for the Democratic Republic of Congo 
from ZAI to DRC, and changed the label for Rumania from RUM to ROM.
